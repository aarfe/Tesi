General Info about meta-modelling   :Pag7 \cite{AcceleoUserGuide}

- MEtamodelling is a vast domain
--- MetaModelling has been formalizaed by OMG, known as MOF Meta-Modeling Facilities
----- MOF is itself a model, represented as a tree. It is considered a meta-meta-model as it can be used to describe many other meta-models. This is possible thanks to the fact that its components are basic, and form the atomic pieces used to create other models. 
For example, if a map represents a model of a region, existing in the real world, its meta-model would contain the basic elements to represent such a map, namely, a legend. This meta-model would contain elements such as roads, highways, rivers, cities, villages etc. In this context, a meta-meta-model would go further deep in the description, containing the structure of the atomic elements to represent the elements of the meta-model (the legend); for example, of a river, it would present a model containing name, depth, length, etc.  

Basically, a model is an instance of a meta-model \cite{UnderstandMetamodelling}. 


%---- XMI is the standard from OMG to transform, interchange, and express any model realized with the MOF.
