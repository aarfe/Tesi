%\subsection{Orchestration/Choreography (maybe Composition?) in a lightweight scenario}
%- Distributed System, why they are heavy and what are some specific problems during the deployment of a Composition(problems we won't encounter in JavaRMI, speed, check my BPEL project for more) \nl
%- Lightweight scenario: why do we move here (mobile phones, Java runs everywhere, technology not ready to run BPEL engine everywhere) \nl
