The WebServer has been creted with:
Eclipse Helios JEEE 3.6.2 

The BPEL Processes are creted adding to Helios 3.6.2 the Plugin BPEL Designer v. 0.5.0 (Version 1.0.0 should be ok too)

The ODE engine (v. 1.3) to run the BPEL process has been deployed as a web service on a Apache Tomacat server (v. 3.3), because both normally run on port 8080 (See tutorial http://people.apache.org/~vanto/HelloWorld-BPELDesignerAndODE.pdf).
